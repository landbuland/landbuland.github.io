## 0. 写在前面

In this model, `saving rate` is no longer exogenous, in other words, it is determined by households and firms in competitive market.



It is an overlapping generation model (OLG) developed by Ramsey, Cass and Koopmans in 1928, 1965 and 1965 respectively.



## 1. Assumptions

**Function form**: $$F(K,AL)$$ and $$F(\bullet)$$ also satisfies two conditions.

- Inada Conditions
- Homogeneous Degree of 1



**Growth rate**: *A* grows at rate *g* and *L* grows at rate *n*, all positive.



**Capital Accumulation**: `no depreciation`

$$
\dot{K}(t)=Y(t)-\zeta(t)
$$

where $$\zeta$$ implies the `total consumption`, while *C* (in capital form) represents the consumption per person and *c* in ordinary form denotes the consumption per effective labor.



**Firm Production**: each firm can produce with a function of $$F(K,AL)$$. Their target is to maximize their profit in the competitive market. They rent capital ( *K* ) and purchase labor ( *L* ) from households.



**Capital Supply**: from household, all capital owned by households go to firms.



**Labor Supply**: from households, one member in households owns one unit of labor. 



**Labor's Utility**: Households max their Utility by determining the ratio of consumption and saving.

$$
U=\int_{t=0}^{\infty} e^{-\rho t} u(C(t)) \frac{L(t)}{H} d t
$$

where 

- $$u(\bullet)$$: 当期household 的utility ,是消费的函数

- *L(t)* : Total labor force (population)

- *H*: number of households

- $$\frac{L(t)}{H}$$: number of members of households

- $$\rho$$ : discount rate
