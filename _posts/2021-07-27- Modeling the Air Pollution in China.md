# Modeling the Air Pollution in China -- Based on Gaussian Process

## Abstract
The Gaussian Process (GP) is a powerful model in machine learning that is capable
to represent the distribution of functions. In this report, I first go through some
basic concepts and intuitions of how the Gaussian Process works, and then bring the
model to the air pollution data in China. I apply the Gaussian Process to model
the air pollution from the perspective of time and geography. The result shows that
the pollution level experiences dierent hour trend between northern and southern
cities, and northern cities may experience more sever pollution in aggregate.
