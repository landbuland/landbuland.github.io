Welcome!

My name is Zihan Zhang, an economic PhD student.

I originally built this website on March 22, 2019, during my time as an undergraduate at Xiamen University. The main motivation for creating it was to earn extra credit in my applied microeconometrics course. Our instructor, Jiaming, offered additional points for submitting assignments through personal websites, so I took the opportunity to post my work here. I now use this website as my blog, where I occasionally update it by uploading notes and other content.
