## Abstract
Game Theory could be applied in Basketball playing in terms of selecting the
offense and defense strategy. We develop The Offense and Defense Strategies Mod-
els" to analyze the optimal strategy under different circumstances. We simplify
the strategies to shoot 2 and shoot 3. Then, we use linear regression models to
estimate the payoff which is the winning probability. After taking in the practical
data for each team, we solve the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium. Theoretically,
it is the optimal distribution of shooting opportunities. Finally, we compare it with
the team's actual performance in NBA 2016-2017 regular season and try to provide
some potential interpretations.

## Keywords:
##### Game Theory, Optimal strategy, Mixed Strategy

## Future Improvements
First, we would like to carry out some rubustness test to check out our results. Similarily, some other dataset have been considered to be applied for the same reasons.
Second, we are considering how to modify the model used for estimation, making it more precise and valid for the cases tthat are not included in our data.
